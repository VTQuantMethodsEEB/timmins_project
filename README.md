# timmins_project
# This project is used to determine how vapor pressure deficit impacts fungal loads,
#tissue invasion, and survival of little brown bats with white-nose syndrome over time.

#I am making changes to test commit and push

#week 2

#upload paragraph from first assignment:

#Maybe I can use the time this semester to explore VPD in other species?

# This dataset is a collection of infection data and climate data accumulated over the past
# decade or so. My main variables of interest are lgdL or fungal loads, UV scores or
# tissue invasion, logVPD or log transformed vapor pressure deficit, and avgTEMP or
# hierarchical temperature averages. I would like to explore the relationship between
# vapor pressure deficit, temperature, and different measures of disease.
